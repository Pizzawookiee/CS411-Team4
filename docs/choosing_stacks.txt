Node based stack (like MERN)
Advantages)
→ most tutorials on pulling data from Spotify API were written in Node
→ Node has puppeteer module which was great for webscraping; python has limited options for webscraping Google Trends
→ Javascript both for server and client 
→ Asynchronous I/O 
→

Drawbacks)
→ Nobody on the team had prior experience
→ runs asynchronously rather than linearly, so more complexity

Django stack
Advantages)
→ familiar with Python

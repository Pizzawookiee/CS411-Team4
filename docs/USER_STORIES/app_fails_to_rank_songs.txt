As a frequent user of Spotify, I would like to have more information on the songs in my playlist such as rankings and other measurable statistics for the songs
of my playlist. Spotify does not display a ranking of the songs on my playlists and it would be interesting to know the popularity of the songs
I am listening to. 

The user logs into the app. They see the following two fields:

Spotify playlist link: 

Put in anything (or nothing) to rank songs by:


The user puts in a Spotify playlist link for the first field, and any keyword (empty or non-empty) for the second field.
The user inputs a valid Spotify playlist link and a keyword (empty or non-empty, doesn't matter). The app returns an error message like this:

ERROR: UNABLE TO RANK SONGS
Possible errors in ranking song:
User inputs a invalid link or URL or the playlist is not set to public
Limited information on a certain song in playlist resulting in missing ranking for certain songs.

The final version of the app does not match initial user stories.

Original functionality was to rank songs in a Spotify playlist by "degrees of separation" from a keyword using Google Trends data.

For example, a song title would be sent to Google Trends, which would return a list of related queries. If the keyword appears in this first set of queries
the degree of separation is 1. If the keyword appears in the set of queries related to the first query set, degree of separation is 2.

This proved to be prohibitively complicated to code and too inefficient to implement due to the Puppeteer scraping of Google Trends serving as a bottleneck.
So, the app just returns an array of lists of Google Trends related queries for each song title in a Spotify playlist.

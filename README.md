HOW TO RUN APP:

Prereqs: Node and npm

1) git clone repo
2) Windows Users: open command prompt configured to use Node and npm ("Node.js command prompt" from Windows key search menu works)
3) cd into prototype folder within the repo, type "npm install" then type "node server.js". Let the file run, don't close the window.
4) ask on Discord channel for certain files which are not shared
5) Open a second window of "Node.js command prompt". cd into prototype/react_frontend, type "npm install" then type "npm start"; a pop-up of the app should appear in your browser
6) you should see a "Log In" button on the top right of your screen. Click it, log into Spotify.

HOW TO RUN APP:

Prereqs: Node and npm

1) git clone repo
2) Windows Users: open command prompt configured to use Node and npm ("Node.js command prompt" from Windows key search menu works)
3) cd into prototype, type "npm install" then type "node server.js"
4) cd into prototype/react_frontend, type "npm install" then type "npm start"; a pop-up of the app should appear in your browser
5) to see outputs of app, open console while in the tab while using it; for Firefox, the binding is Ctrl-Shift-K
